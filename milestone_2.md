# Second Milestone

## What was the original goal of your project?

My original goal was to have a searchable API that returned statistics on certain characters or places.

## How have the goals of your project changed?

I wasn't gaining enough ground because I was getting back into harnessing APIs, so I slowed down and pulled a picture from the Internet. Then I switched over to a database API, which is working out very well.

## What is a significant thing that you learned while building this project?

I learned how to understand threads. Lots of the time, APIs run in the background, which happens in a different part of the CPU. Some processes, like changing the label's text, have to be run the main part of the CPU, or the main thread. Therefore, when calling an API function and changing the text, you have to move the text part into the main thread, even though everything else is running in the background.

## Describe an unexpected challenge that came up during this project, and how you overcame it.

One unexpected challenge was that I forgot how to use APIs. A lot of the project was relearning how to request data and how to organize that JSON data. Luckily, I feel much more confident now that I have made it this far with building this app.

## Knowing what you know now, if you were to rebuild this project completely from scratch, what would you do differently, and why?

I would clean up the code a lot, reorganize functions and have it do much more. After this milestone, I am going to keep developing the UI and the back-end code to make this app a much more user-friendly environment. I love building API apps, so this app is one where development doesn't just need to be for school. I would also fix constraint issues from the start. Another thing is that I would organize my goals for this project more. I felt like I was winging it some of the time. A more organized battle plan would have helped me a lot.
