## Pentatonix API App

I'm not sure if I would call this an API app, but it fetches a picture from the web.
It uses `URLSession` to get a url string and display the picture in an ImageView.

This project was very tough to get going, because it involved web requests. This slowed me down quite a bit. 
But now since I know how to make web requests, I can move forward with the project.

The original goal of the project was to search a Harry Potter API. 
I simplified it for the milestone because I had no idea how to search it.
But now I am ready to use a database API and use the search function.
